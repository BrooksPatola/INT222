			<span class="fontLetter">G</span>rowing up in Thunder Bay installed in me a great appreciation for nature and many outdoor activities at an early age.
				I learned to skate at the age of two, as many other young children in the area do as well. Hockey was a fundamental part 
				of life throughout my childhood years, and I enjoyed the competition and nature of belonging to a team. Living in Northern Ontario,
				gave the sense that it was very isolate from the rest of the country. One of the major downfalls was the blistering cold winters,
				which during these times I grew accustomed to loving to play video games and reading many novels. My aspirations at this time,
				if I was not to make it playing hockey professionally, was to either be a writer or someone who has the power and knowledge to
				 create beautiful things out of the ether. 
				</p>

				<p>
				I did well enough in high school to receive a scholarship to Brock University where I went to study Psychology. During my first year,
				I stayed with my Great Aunt and Uncle in Niagara-on-the-Lake which I thought was a historically beautiful place to be. 
				Although I enjoyed Brock and the surrounding area, I wanted to come to Toronto to live in the city while I received my education.
				After my first year was completed I transferred to York University, where I remained for the following three years. 
				Although I enjoyed Psychology, mainly the section of neuroscience, I didn't feel as I wanted to be in that field for the remainder of my time on earth.
				Going back to what I wanted to do as a younger kid...having the ability to create and design useful things for myself and others to use,
				I decided it would be wise to go into the avenue of learning how to program in different languages. This is what made me apply to the program
				I'm currently in at Seneca (CPA).  
				</p>

				Considering my aspirations after graduation, they remain fairly open for consideration. I would love to work for myself and have the ability to travel the
				 world at will.
				Thailand seems like it would be an interesting place to stay for a period of time once I have certain abilities that will allow this to transpire. 
				The ocean, exotic food, adventure, and cheap living expenses sound good to me. Currently, related to the field of programming, 
				I enjoy reading/learning about the many possibilities of neural networks and how they apply to Artificial Intelligence. 
				I've been reading many articles contributed by Geoffrey Hinton who is a researcher at Google and UofT respectively.
				 If I can contribute something to the advancement of 
				society or to make the joy in someone's life a little bit brighter, I will consider this path of the right choosing.
